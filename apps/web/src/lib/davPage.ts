/**
 * Client-side paging for the bucket browser.
 *
 * The page number lives in the URL (`?page=`), next to the existing `?path=` and
 * `?backend=`, so a folder+page link is shareable and survives refresh and
 * back/forward. The page *size* is a preference rather than navigation state, so
 * it lives in `localStorage` instead — putting it in the URL would make every
 * size change push a history entry.
 *
 * Values arriving from the URL are untrusted: `?page=` is hand-editable, so it is
 * clamped here and again in the backend. The two clamps are not redundant — this
 * one keeps a nonsense URL from issuing a request at all, the backend's is what
 * actually bounds the work.
 *
 * The constants mirror `packages/dav-store/src/listing.ts` in Durable-DAV. They
 * are duplicated rather than shared because the SPA has no workspace runtime
 * dependency on a server package; the router's job is to talk to a backend over
 * HTTP, not to link against its source.
